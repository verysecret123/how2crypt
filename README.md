# Educational Crypto in Python

This repo is for learning various cryptographic concepts and techniques.

# RSA

| File | Technique | Applicable CTF Challenges |
|------|-----------|---------------------------|
| [modular_arithmetic.py](modular_arithmetic.py) | Introduction to modular arithmetic | |
| [rsa.py](rsa.py) | Introduction to RSA encryption | |
| [rsa_exponentfault.py](rsa_exponentfault.py) | Recover the secret exponent when unpadded RSA (non-CRT) is used and random bitflips affect the secret exponent |[Broken box - CSAW quals 2016](https://ctftime.org/task/2825]) |

# Elliptic Curve

Have a good example?
Add it here!
Try to inline the whole technique in a single `.py` -- it's a lot easier to learn that way.
